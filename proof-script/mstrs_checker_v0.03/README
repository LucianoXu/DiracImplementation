mstrsck v0.03
=============

Syntax checker for many-sorted TRSs in MSTRS format

This tool checks the following adequateness of given MSTRS specification:
 * syntax check
 * variable conditions
 * well-sortedness
 * whether there exist multiple sorts 

It quetly exits if no problem found. Otherwise it reports some error.

Options:
 -t : It outputs the first-order TRS if the signature 
      consists of one sort and many-sorted TRS otherwise.
 -tt : It outputs the first-order TRS obtained by identifying all sorts.
 -r : It reads a first-order TRS and output the many-sorted TRS 
      obtained by attaching a unique sort "o".

The system is tested on SML/NJ v110.77. You need SML/NJ to be installed 
on your box. 

To compile the tool on a Linux box, run 
 $ make
to obtain "mstrsck.x86-linux".

To run the command, 
 $ sml @SMLload=mstrsck.x86-linux filename

For non x86-linux systems, invoke the SML/NJ interpreter, 
and run
 - CM.make "sources.cm";
 - SMLofNJ.exportFn ("mstrsck", Main.main);
to compile. Also replace "x86-linux" accordingly to run.

You can also compile to a native code on a Linux box using mlton. 
For this, run
 $ make native
to obtain "mstrsck".

You can find sample files in the director ./examples.
