\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented an approach to automating formal deductions in a more general setting using Dirac notations. Our methodology leverages term rewriting systems to provide a robust, explainable framework with theoretical guarantees, which is critical for the performance and usability of formal tools in quantum computing.

We have demonstrated the implementation of our core language in Mathematica, verified various case studies, and shown the practical applicability of our approach. Our results affirm the soundness and completeness of the rewriting rules and their capability to handle complex calculations effectively.


Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rewriting Rules Optimization:} 
  Rearranging the rewriting rules in the core language to improve efficiency and scalability.
  \item \textbf{Language Extension:} 
  Incorporating more sorts (e.g., super operators), finer typing (e.g., unitary, Hermitian, positive operators), and more predicates (e.g., order judgement).
  \item \textbf{AI Intergration:} As future extensions make the formal system more and more sophisticated, we should introduce artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to facilitate automated deduction, aiming to overcome the limitation in generating capability of traditional term rewriting systems.
\end{itemize}
